U.S. States Game
This educational Python game uses the Turtle and Pandas libraries to test knowledge of U.S. states. Players type state names into a dialog box, and if the name is correct, it appears on a U.S. map. The game records missed states in a "states_to_learn.csv" file, creating a personalized list for further learning. This project provides an engaging way to learn U.S. geography!
